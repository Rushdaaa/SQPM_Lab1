# Binary Calculator Project

This project implements a **Binary Calculator** in Java using Maven. It allows operations on binary numbers, including **addition**, **bitwise OR**, **bitwise AND**, and **multiplication**. The project includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of all operations and generates documentation and reports using Maven plugins.

## Features

1. **Binary Class**:
   - Perform operations on binary numbers, such as:
     - **Addition**: Adds two binary numbers.
     - **Bitwise OR**: Performs a logical OR between two binary numbers.
     - **Bitwise AND**: Performs a logical AND between two binary numbers.
     - **Multiplication**: Multiplies two binary numbers (using addition internally).

2. **Unit Testing**:
   - Extensive test coverage for all operations using JUnit 5.
   - Tests include edge cases like invalid binary inputs, empty strings, and operations with zero.

3. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation generated using Maven Javadoc plugin.
   - Includes descriptions of all methods, parameters, and return values.

4. **Reports**:
   - Surefire report summarizing the test results.
   - Site report generated using Maven, including all relevant project information.
